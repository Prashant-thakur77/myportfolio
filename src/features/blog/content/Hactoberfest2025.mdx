## About Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is a global, month-long open-source celebration encouraging developers to contribute to meaningful projects and collaborate with communities around the world.

During Hacktoberfest 2025, I actively participated by contributing to multiple open-source organizations, working on production-grade repositories, and following real-world open-source workflows.

## Organizations & Work

### Learning Equality

A major portion of my Hacktoberfest contributions focused on **Learning Equality**, an organization dedicated to providing equitable access to education worldwide.

My work included:

- Migrating UI components from Vuetify to the Kolibri Design System (KDS)
- Improving accessibility and visual consistency
- Refactoring components for better reusability and clarity
- Aligning code with design system standards
- Iterating on feedback through maintainer reviews

This required understanding a large, evolving codebase and adhering to strict contribution guidelines.

### Other Open Source Projects

Alongside Learning Equality, I also contributed to other open-source repositories, working on:

- Bug fixes and enhancements
- Code cleanup and refactoring
- Documentation improvements
- Issue-based contributions validated through CI

Each contribution followed community standards and review-driven development.

## What I Learned

Hacktoberfest strengthened my understanding of:

- Navigating large codebases
- Writing clean, review-ready pull requests
- Communicating clearly with maintainers
- Iterating based on feedback
- Making small but impactful changes

It reinforced the importance of clarity, collaboration, and consistency in open-source development.

## Why Hacktoberfest Matters to Me

Hacktoberfest is more than completing pull requests—it's about:

- Giving back to the open-source ecosystem
- Learning from real production systems
- Building software with real-world impact
- Growing as a developer through collaboration

This experience motivated me to continue contributing to open-source projects beyond Hacktoberfest.
